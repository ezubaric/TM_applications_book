  abstract	= {{We consider learning in a Markov decision process where
		  we are not explicitly given a reward function, but where
		  instead we can observe an expert demonstrating the task
		  that we want to learn to perform. This setting is useful in
		  applications (such as the task of driving) where it may be
		  difficult to write down an explicit reward function
		  specifying exactly how different desiderata should be
		  traded off. We think of the expert as trying to maximize a
		  reward function that is expressible as a linear combination
		  of known features, and give an algorithm for learning the
		  task demonstrated by the expert. Our algorithm is based on
		  using "inverse reinforcement learning" to try to recover
		  the unknown reward function. We show that our algorithm
		  terminates in a small number of iterations, and that even
		  though we may never recover the expert's reward function,
		  the policy output by the algorithm will attain performance
		  close to that of the expert, where here performance is
		  measured with respect to the expert's unknown reward
		  function.}},

@InProceedings{	  banko-07,
  abstract	= {Traditionally, Information Extraction (IE) has focused on
		  satisfying precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from
		  small homogeneous corpora (e.g., extract the location and
		  time of seminars from a set of announcements). Shifting to
		  a new domain requires the user to name the target relations
		  and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new
		  training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with
		  the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open
		  IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes
		  a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a
		  large set of relational tuples without requiring any human
		  input. The paper also introduces TextRunner, a fully
		  implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples
		  are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient
		  extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on
		  experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare
		  TextRunner with KnowItAll, a state-of-the-art Web IE
		  system. TextRunner achieves an error reduction of 33\% on a
		  comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount
		  of time it takes KnowItAll to perform extraction for a
		  handful of pre-specified relations, TextRunner extracts a
		  far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude
		  more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics
		  on TextRunner's 11,000,000 highest probability tuples and
		  show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and
		  over 6,500,000 more abstract assertions.},

		  distributions over terms that are automatically extracted
		  from large text corpora using latent variable models. Our
		  method finds significant \$n\$-grams related to a topic,
		  which are then used to help understand and interpret the
		  underlying distribution. Compared with the usual
		  visualization, which simply lists the most probable topical
		  terms, the multi-word expressions provide a better
		  intuitive impression for what a topic is "about." Our
		  approach is based on a language model of arbitrary length
		  expressions, for which we develop a new methodology based
		  on nested permutation tests to find significant phrases. We
		  show that this method outperforms the more standard use of
		  \$\chi^2\$ and likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the
		  topic presentations on corpora of scientific abstracts and

  abstract	= "Background: Public health officials and policy makers in
		  the United States expend significant resources at the
		  national, state, county, and city levels to measure the
		  rate of influenza infection. These individuals rely on
		  influenza infection rate information to make important
		  decisions during the course of an influenza season driving
		  vaccination campaigns, clinical guidelines, and medical
		  staffing. Web and social media data sources have emerged as
		  attractive alternatives to supplement existing practices.
		  While traditional surveillance methods take 1-2 weeks, and
		  significant labor, to produce an infection estimate in each
		  locale, web and social media data are available in near
		  real-time for a broad range of locations. Objective: The
		  objective of this study was to analyze the efficacy of flu
		  surveillance from combining data from the websites Google
		  Flu Trends and HealthTweets at the local level. We
		  considered both emergency department influenza-like illness
		  cases and laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for a single
		  hospital in the City of Baltimore. Methods: This was a
		  retrospective observational study comparing estimates of
		  influenza activity of Google Flu Trends and Twitter to
		  actual counts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed
		  influenza, and counts of individuals presenting to the
		  emergency department with influenza-like illness cases.
		  Data were collected from November 20, 2011 through March
		  16, 2014. Each parameter was evaluated on the municipal,
		  regional, and national scale. We examined the utility of
		  social media data for tracking actual influenza infection
		  at the municipal, state, and national levels. Specifically,
		  we compared the efficacy of Twitter and Google Flu Trends
		  data. Results: We found that municipal-level Twitter data
		  was more effective than regional and national data when
		  tracking actual influenza infection rates in a Baltimore
		  inner-city hospital. When combined, national-level Twitter
		  and Google Flu Trends data outperformed each data source
		  individually. In addition, influenza-like illness data at
		  all levels of geographic granularity were best predicted by
		  national Google Flu Trends data. Conclusions: In order to
		  overcome sensitivity to transient events, such as the news
		  cycle, the best-fitting Google Flu Trends model relies on a
		  4-week moving average, suggesting that it may also be
		  sacrificing sensitivity to transient fluctuations in
		  influenza infection to achieve predictive power.
		  Implications for influenza forecasting are discussed in
		  this report. ",

		  2) they are words; 3) words paired may be but need not be
		  semantically identical; 4) there is always some kind of
		  formal resemblance between cognates. I argue that these
		  properties can be explained in terms of a particular model
		  of lexical activation and word recognition, namely the
		  Cohort Model. I also take up the question of defining
		  cognates for psycho linguistic purposes and argue against
		  using traditional extensional definitions based on

		  cognates in terms of their structural representations and
		  the processes which activate and select them. },

  abstract	= {How do we decide how to represent an intelligent system in
		  its interface, and how do we decide how the interface
		  represents information about the world and about its own
		  workings to a user? This article addresses these questions
		  by examining the interaction between representation and
		  intelligence in user interfaces. The rubric representation
		  covers at least three topics in this context: (1) how a
		  computational system is represented in its user interface,
		  (2) how the interface conveys its representations of
		  information and the world to human users, and (3) how the
		  system's internal representation affects the human user's
		  interaction with the system. I argue that each of these
		  kinds of representation (of the system, information and the
		  world, the interaction) is key to how users make the kind
		  of attributions of intelligence that facilitate their
		  interactions with intelligent systems. In this vein, it
		  makes sense to represent a systmem as a human in those
		  cases where social collaborative behavior is key and for
		  the system to represent its knowledge to humans in multiple
		  ways on multiple modalities. I demonstrate these claims by
		  discussing issues of representation and intelligence in an
		  embodied conversational agent -- an interface in which the
		  system is represented as a person, information is conveyed
		  to human users by multiple modalities such as voice and
		  hand gestures, and the internal representation is modality
		  independent and both propositional and nonpropositional.},

  abstract	= {Current research on the influence of electronic
		  communication technologies such as electronic mail, World
		  Wide Web, electronic journals, bibliographic databases and
		  on-line card catalogs suggest that they broaden academic
		  research communities and change the ways researchers work.
		  However, it is less well-understood how these changes take
		  place. One explanation is that the mechanism for change is
		  generational: doctoral students transform research
		  disciplines as they apply new electronic communication
		  skills they ?grew up with.? This article examines this
		  explanation and related claims through evidence from a
		  study of 28 graduate students and their advisors in four
		  disciplines at eight U.S. research universities. Although
		  all the doctoral students used electronic communication
		  technologies in various ways, their work practices
		  reinforced existing patterns of work and resource use in
		  their disciplines. Students used electronic communication
		  to (1) mimic the electronic communication patterns of their
		  advisor, (2) differentiate or specialize their research
		  with respect to their advisor or research specialty, (3)
		  enhance the social connections and material resources their
		  advisor or institution provided to them, and/or (4) ease or
		  improve ?hands-on? research techniques (textual analysis,
		  wet lab work, programming, statistical analysis) that their
		  advisor or research group delegated to them.},

		  using an innovative activation paradigm specifically
		  designed to unequivocally disentangle syntactic from

		  strongly indicate that a part of Broca's area (BA 44, pars

		  syntactic information, whereas the lower portion of the
		  left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47, pars orbitalis) is
		  selectively involved in processing the semantic aspects of

  abstract	= {The most basic assumption used in statistical learning
		  theory is that training data and test data are drawn from
		  the same underlying distribution. Unfortunately, in many
		  applications, the "in-domain" test data is drawn from a
		  distribution that is related, but not identical, to the
		  "out-of-domain" distribution of the training data. We
		  consider the common case in which labeled out-of-domain
		  data is plentiful, but labeled in-domain data is scarce. We
		  introduce a statistical formulation of this problem in
		  terms of a simple mixture model and present an
		  instantiation of this framework to maximum entropy
		  classifiers and their linear chain counterparts. We present
		  efficient inference algorithms for this special case based
		  on the technique of conditional expectation maximization.
		  Our experimental results show that our approach leads to
		  improved performance on three real world tasks on four
		  different data sets from the natural language processing
		  domain.},

		  adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the
		  form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our
		  paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic
		  optimization and online learning which employ proximal
		  functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm.
		  We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively
		  modifying the proximal function, which significantly
		  simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret
		  guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal
		  function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several
		  efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization
		  problems with common and important regularization functions
		  and domain constraints. We experimentally study our
		  theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient
		  methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art, yet
		  non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.}

  abstract	= {{This book describes the main objective of EuroWordNet,
		  which is the building of a multilingual database with
		  lexical semantic networks or wordnets for several European
		  languages. Each wordnet in the database represents a
		  language-specific structure due to the unique
		  lexicalization of concepts in languages. The concepts are
		  inter-linked via a separate Inter-Lingual-Index, where
		  equivalent concepts across languages should share the same
		  index item. The flexible multilingual design of the
		  database makes it possible to compare the lexicalizations
		  and semantic structures, revealing answers to fundamental
		  linguistic and philosophical questions which could never be
		  answered before. How consistent are lexical semantic
		  networks across languages, what are the language-specific
		  differences of these networks, is there a
		  language-universal ontology, how much information can be
		  shared across languages? First attempts to answer these
		  questions are given in the form of a set of shared or
		  common Base Concepts that has been derived from the
		  separate wordnets and their classification by a
		  language-neutral top-ontology. These Base Concepts play a
		  fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless, the
		  database may also serve many practical needs with respect
		  to (cross-language) information retrieval, machine
		  translation tools, language generation tools and language
		  learning tools, which are discussed in the final chapter.
		  <br/> The book offers an excellent introduction to the
		  EuroWordNet project for scholars in the field and raises
		  many issues that set the directions for further research in
		  semantics and knowledge engineering.}},

  abstract	= {We describe extensions to the method of Pritchard et al.
		  for inferring population structure from multilocus genotype
		  data. Most importantly, we develop methods that allow for
		  linkage between loci. The new model accounts for the
		  correlations between linked loci that arise in admixed
		  populations ("admixture linkage disequilibium"). This
		  modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection
		  of admixture events farther back into the past, (2)
		  inference of the population of origin of chromosomal
		  regions and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical
		  uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of
		  potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we
		  describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies
		  within each population, which allows identification of
		  subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable
		  using the existing method. We present results applying the
		  new methods to study admixture in African-Americans,
		  recombination in Helicobacter pylori and drift in
		  populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The methods are
		  implemented in a program, structure, version 2.0, which is
		  available at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu.},

@Article{	  genetag,
  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Named entity recognition (NER) is an important
		  first step for text mining the biomedical literature.
		  Evaluating the performance of biomedical NER systems is
		  impossible without a standardized test corpus. The
		  annotation of such a corpus for gene/protein name NER is a
		  difficult process due to the complexity of gene/protein
		  names. We describe the construction and annotation of
		  GENETAG, a corpus of 20K MEDLINE sentences for gene/protein
		  NER. 15K GENETAG sentences were used for the BioCreAtIvE
		  Task 1A Competition. RESULTS: To ensure heterogeneity of
		  the corpus, MEDLINE sentences were first scored for term
		  similarity to documents with known gene names and 10K high-
		  and 10K low-scoring sentences were chosen at random. The
		  original 20K sentences were run through a gene/protein name
		  tagger and the results were modified manually to reflect a
		  wide definition of gene/protein names subject to a
		  specificity constraint, a rule that required the tagged
		  entities to refer to specific entities. Each sentence in
		  GENETAG was annotated with acceptable alternatives to the
		  gene/protein names it contained, allowing for partial
		  matching with semantic constraints. Semantic constraints
		  are rules requiring the tagged entity to contain its true
		  meaning in the sentence context. Application of these
		  constraints results in a more meaningful measure of the
		  performance of an NER system than unrestricted partial
		  matching. CONCLUSION: The annotation of GENETAG required
		  intricate manual judgments by annotators which hindered
		  tagging consistency. The data were pre-segmented into
		  words, to provide indices supporting comparison of system
		  responses to the "gold standard". However, character-based
		  indices would have been more robust than word-based
		  indices. GENETAG Train, Test and Round1 data and ancillary
		  programs are freely available at
		  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/tanabe/GENETAG.tar.gz. A
		  newer version of GENETAG-05, will be released later this
		  year.},

  abstract	= {{"Why did crime in New York drop so suddenly in the
		  mid-90s? How does an unknown novelist end up a bestselling
		  author? Why is teenage smoking out of control, when
		  everyone knows smoking kills? What makes TV shows like
		  Sesame Street so good at teaching kids how to read? Why did
		  Paul Revere succeed with his famous warning? In this
		  brilliant and groundbreaking book, New Yorker writer
		  Malcolm Gladwell looks at why major changes in our society
		  so often happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Ideas, behavior,
		  messages, and products, he argues, often spread like
		  outbreaks of infectious disease. Just as a single sick
		  person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few
		  fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave,
		  or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new
		  restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when
		  they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the
		  Tipping Point. <P>In The Tipping Point, Gladwell introduces
		  us to the particular personality types who are natural
		  pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create
		  the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion
		  trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail and the
		  early days of the American Revolution for clues about
		  making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a
		  successful high-tech company, and one of the world's
		  greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social
		  epidemics. The Tipping Point is an intellectual adventure
		  story written with an infectious enthusiasm for the power
		  and joy of new ideas. Most of all, it is a road map to
		  change, with a profoundly hopeful message--that one
		  imaginative person applying a well-placed lever can move
		  the world."}},

  abstract	= {The minimum description length (MDL) principle is a
		  powerful method of inductive inference, the basis of
		  statistical modeling, pattern recognition, and machine
		  learning. It holds that the best explanation, given a
		  limited set of observed data, is the one that permits the
		  greatest compression of the data. MDL methods are
		  particularly well-suited for dealing with model selection,
		  prediction, and estimation problems in situations where the
		  models under consideration can be arbitrarily complex, and
		  overfitting the data is a serious concern. This extensive,
		  step-by-step introduction to the MDL Principle provides a
		  comprehensive reference (with an emphasis on conceptual
		  issues) that is accessible to graduate students and
		  researchers in statistics, pattern classification, machine
		  learning, and data mining, to philosophers interested in
		  the foundations of statistics, and to researchers in other
		  applied sciences that involve model selection, including
		  biology, econometrics, and experimental psychology. Part I
		  provides a basic introduction to MDL and an overview of the
		  concepts in statistics and information theory needed to
		  understand MDL. Part II treats universal coding, the
		  information-theoretic notion on which MDL is built, and
		  part III gives a formal treatment of MDL theory as a theory
		  of inductive inference based on universal coding. Part IV
		  provides a comprehensive overview of the statistical theory
		  of exponential families with an emphasis on their
		  information-theoretic properties. The text includes a
		  number of summaries, paragraphs offering the reader a
		  \&quot;fast track\&quot; through the material, and boxes
		  highlighting the most important concepts.},

		  information conveyed to a hearer by a speaker emitting a
		  sentence generated by a probabilistic grammar known to both
		  parties. The method applies the work of Grenander (1967) to
		  the intermediate states of a top-down parser. This allows
		  the uncertainty about structural ambiguity to be calculated
		  at each point in a sentence. Subtracting these values at
		  successive points gives the information conveyed by a word
		  in a sentence. Word-by-word information conveyed is
		  calculated for several small probabilistic grammars, and it
		  is suggested that the number of bits conveyed per word is a
		  determinant of reading times and other measures of

  comment	= {When costs of computation are not taken into account,
		  optimal policies can be determined using dynamic
		  programming [Howard and Matheson, 1984; Shachter, 1986].
		  When the costs of computation are not negligible, the cost
		  of computing the optimal policy using dynamic programming
		  may be prohibitive. We have developed an algorithm which
		  can be used to compute policies for large multi-stage
		  decision problems under uncertainty represented as
		  influence diagrams. Our approach is incremental, and uses
		  abstraction. An influence diagram(ID) is a DAG representing
		  a sequential decision problem under uncertainty [Howard and
		  Matheson, 1984]. An ID models the subjective beliefs,
		  preferences, and available actions from the perspective of
		  a single decision maker. A decision tree represents a
		  decision function. The single stage information refinement
		  algorithm constructs a decision tree for a influence
		  diagram with a single decision node. A policy is
		  represented by a collection of decision trees, one for each
		  decision node in the influence diagram. A deterministic
		  decision tree is an inappropriate representation for a
		  decision function in a multi-stage policywhich is being
		  refined. For multi--stage decision problems, the refinement
		  may have ramifications for the global policy. Neither of
		  these complications occur for single-stage problems.},

  abstract	= { Topic models have been studied extensively in the context
		  of monolingual corpora. Though there are some attempts to
		  mine topical structure from cross-lingual corpora, they
		  require clues about document alignments. In this paper we
		  present a generative model called JointLDA which uses a
		  bilingual dictionary to mine multilingual topics from an
		  unaligned corpus. Experiments conducted on different data
		  sets confirm our conjecture that jointly modeling the
		  cross-lingual corpora offers several advantages compared to
		  individual monolingual models. Since the JointLDA model
		  merges related topics in different languages into a single
		  multilingual topic: a) it can fit the data with relatively
		  fewer topics. b) it has the ability to predict related
		  words from a language different than that of the given
		  document. In fact it has better predictive power compared
		  to the bag-of-word based translation model leaving the
		  possibility for JointLDA to be preferred over bag-of-word
		  model for cross-lingual IR applications. We also found that
		  the monolingual models learnt while optimizing the
		  cross-lingual copora are more effective than the
		  corresponding LDA models. },

@Article{	  jurafsky-96,
  abstract	= {{The problems of access--retrieving linguistic structure
		  from some mental grammar --and disambiguation--choosing
		  among these structures to correctly parse ambiguous
		  linguistic input--are fundamental to language
		  understanding. The literature abounds with psychological
		  results on lexical access, the access of idioms, syntactic
		  rule access, parsing preferences, syntactic disambiguation,
		  and the processing of garden-path sentences. Unfortunately,
		  it has been difficult to combine models which account for
		  these results to build a general, uniform model of access
		  and disambiguation at the lexical, idiomatic, and syntactic
		  levels. For example, psycholinguistic theories of lexical
		  access and idiom access and parsing theories of syntactic
		  rule access have almost no commonality in methodology or
		  coverage of psycholinguistic data. This article presents a
		  single probabilistic algorithm which models both the access
		  and disambiguation of linguistic knowledge. The algorithm
		  is based on a parallel parser which ranks constructions for
		  access, and interpretations for disambiguation, by their
		  conditional probability. Low-ranked constructions and
		  interpretations are pruned through beam-search; this
		  pruning accounts, among other things, for the garden-path
		  effect. I show that this motivated probabilistic treatment
		  accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results,
		  arguing for a more uniform representation of linguistic
		  knowledge and for the use of probabilistically-enriched
		  grammars and interpreters as models of human knowledge of
		  and processing of language.}},

		  Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?. The player consists of a

		  question-answering module utilizes question transformation
		  techniques, natural language parsing, multiple information
		  retrieval algorithms, and multiple search engines; results
		  are combined in the spirit of ensemble learning using an
		  adaptive weighting scheme. Empirically, the system
		  correctly answers about 75% of questions from the
		  Millionaire CD-ROM, 3rd editiongeneral-interest trivia
		  questions often about popular culture and common knowledge.
		  The decision-making module chooses from allowable actions
		  in the game in order to maximize expected risk-adjusted
		  winnings, where the estimated probability of answering
		  correctly is a function of past performance and confidence
		  in correctly answering the current question. When given a
		  six question head start (i.e., when starting from the
		  \$2,000 level), we find that the system performs about as

		  intellectually created links such as author-chosen keywords
		  and titles, authority indexing terms, or bibliographic
		  citations. Similarity of the semantic content of whole
		  documents, rather than just titles, abstracts, or overlap
		  of keywords, offers an attractive alternative. Latent
		  semantic analysis provides an effective dimension reduction
		  method for the purpose that reflects synonymy and the sense
		  of arbitrary word combinations. However, latent semantic
		  analysis correlations with human text-to-text similarity
		  judgments are often empirically highest at ≈300
		  dimensions. Thus, two- or three-dimensional visualizations
		  are severely limited in what they can show, and the first
		  and/or second automatically discovered principal component,
		  or any three such for that matter, rarely capture all of
		  the relations that might be of interest. It is our
		  conjecture that linguistic meaning is intrinsically and
		  irreducibly very high dimensional. Thus, some method to
		  explore a high dimensional similarity space is needed. But
		  the 2.7 × 107 projections and infinite rotations of, for
		  example, a 300-dimensional pattern are impossible to
		  examine. We suggest, however, that the use of a high
		  dimensional dynamic viewer with an effective projection
		  pursuit routine and user control, coupled with the
		  exquisite abilities of the human visual system to extract
		  information about objects and from moving patterns, can
		  often succeed in discovering multiple revealing views that
		  are missed by current computational algorithms. We show
		  some examples of the use of latent semantic analysis to
		  support such visualizations and offer views on future
		  needs.}},

		  been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has
		  developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time
		  scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of
		  particular named entities. However, these approaches are
		  less well suited to the identification of content that
		  spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order
		  of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and
		  events. We develop a framework for tracking short,
		  distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through
		  on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering
		  textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class
		  of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a
		  daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how
		  such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent
		  representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the
		  news media that have long been the subject of qualitative
		  interpretation but have never been captured accurately
		  enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked
		  1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period
		  of three months with the total of 90 million articles and
		  we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in
		  the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of
		  2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the
		  news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent
		  behavior around the overall peak and a "heartbeat"-like
		  pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also

		  and recall of 78.7\%. An analysis of the contribution of

  abstract	= {This paper proposes an information theoretic criterion for
		  comparing two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data
		  set. The criterion, called variation of information (VI),
		  measures the amount of information lost and gained in
		  changing from clustering \${\cal C}\$ to clustering \${\cal
		  C}'\$ . The criterion makes no assumptions about how the
		  clusterings were generated and applies to both soft and
		  hard clusterings. The basic properties of VI are presented
		  and discussed from the point of view of comparing
		  clusterings. In particular, the VI is positive, symmetric
		  and obeys the triangle inequality. Thus, surprisingly
		  enough, it is a true metric on the space of clusterings.

		  attributes (modification), parts (meronymy) and functions
		  (predication), but only meronymy is presently implemented
		  in the noun files. Antonymy is also found between nouns,
		  but it is not a fundamental organizing principle for nouns.
		  Coverage is partitioned into twenty-five topical files,
		  each of which deals with a different primitive semantic
		  component. Characteristics of each topic are discussed. },

		  similarity is investigated for pairs of nouns that vary
		  from high to low semantic similarity. Semantic similarity
		  is estimated by subjective ratings; contextual similarity
		  is estimated by the method of sorting sentential contexts.
		  The results show an inverse linear relationship between
		  similarity of meaning and the discriminability of contexts.
		  This relation, is obtained for two separate corpora of
		  sentence contexts. It is concluded that, on average, for
		  words in the same language drawn from the same syntactic
		  and semantic categories, the more often two words can be
		  substituted into the same contexts the more similar in
		  meaning they are judged to be.},

		  browsing by extracting useful semantic themes from web
		  pages and other text documents. When learned topics are
		  coherent and interpretable, they can be valuable for
		  faceted browsing, results set diversity analysis, and
		  document retrieval. However, when dealing with small
		  collections or noisy text (e.g. web search result snippets
		  or blog posts), learned topics can be less coherent, less
		  interpretable, and less useful. To overcome this, we
		  propose two methods to regularize the learning of topic
		  models. Our regularizers work by creating a structured
		  prior over words that reflect broad patterns in the
		  external data. Using thirteen datasets we show that both
		  regularizers improve topic coherence and interpretability
		  while learning a faithful representation of the collection
		  of interest. Overall, this work makes topic models more
		  useful across a broader range of text data. ",

  abstract	= {{10.1518/001872006776412180 Objective: The present study
		  examined the relationship between two distinct subfactors
		  of spatial ability and performance in an information search
		  task modeled on browsing the Web. Background: Previous
		  studies have found relationships between various measures
		  of spatial ability and performance in a wide variety of
		  computerbased tasks. Method: In the search task 101
		  participants (18-29 years of age) searched for the answer
		  to a question by navigating the system. They completed the
		  experimental task as well as a battery of cognitive ability
		  measures that included two different measures of spatial
		  ability. Results: The results indicate that spatial
		  orientation ability was related to performance with tasks
		  that were high in their navigational requirement
		  (engendered by the use of a novel aid), whereas spatial
		  visualization was unrelated to performance in any task
		  condition. Conclusion: A closer inspection of the cognitive
		  requirements of a task may reveal what interventions could
		  be most useful when designing computer systems or
		  developing training programs. Application: Given the unique
		  differences between the different spatial abilities, the
		  current results suggest the design of navigational aids
		  that place less demand on spatial orientation ability. Date

  abstract	= {An important part of our information-gathering behavior
		  has always been to find out what other people think. With
		  the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich
		  resources such as online review sites and personal blogs,
		  new opportunities and challenges arise as people can and
		  do, actively use information technologies to seek out and
		  understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of
		  activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment
		  analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of
		  opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus
		  occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge
		  of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions
		  as a first-class object. Opinion Mining and Sentiment
		  Analysis covers techniques and approaches that promise to
		  directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking
		  systems. The focus is on methods that seek to address the
		  new challenges raised by available resources, benchmark
		  datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.
		  Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the first such
		  comprehensive survey of this vibrant and important research
		  area and will be of interest to anyone with sentiment-aware
		  applications, as compared to those that are already present
		  in more traditional fact-based analysis. The survey
		  includes an enumeration of the various applications, a look
		  at general challenges and discusses categorization,
		  extraction and summarization. Finally, it moves beyond just
		  the technical issues, devoting significant attention to the
		  broader implications that the development of

  abstract	= {Language, whether spoken or written, is an important
		  window into people's emotional and cognitive worlds. Text
		  analysis of these narratives, focusing on specific words or
		  classes of words, has been used in numerous research
		  studies including studies of emotional, cognitive,
		  structural and process components of individuals' verbal
		  and written language. It was in this research context that
		  the LIWC program was developed. The program analyzes text
		  files on a word-by-word basis, calculating percentage words
		  that match each of several language dimensions. Its output
		  is a text file that can be opened in any of a variety of
		  applications, including word processors and spreadsheet
		  programs. The program has 68 pre-set dimensions (output
		  variables) including linguistic dimensions, word categories
		  tapping psychological constructs and personal concern
		  categories and can accommodate user-defined dimensions as
		  well. Easy to install and use, this software offers
		  researchers in social, personality, clinical and applied
		  psychology a valuable tool for quantifying the rich but
		  often slippery data provided in the form of personal
		  narratives. The software comes complete on one diskette and
		  runs on any Windows-based computer.},

@Article{	  pitman-97,
  abstract	= {The two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution, denoted
		  $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, \theta)$ is a probability distribution
		  on the set of decreasing positive sequences with sum 1. The
		  usual Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with a single
		  parameter $\theta$, introduced by Kingman, is
		  $\mathsf{PD}(0, \theta)$. Known properties of
		  $\mathsf{PD}(0, \theta)$, including the Markov chain
		  description due to Vershik, Shmidt and Ignatov, are
		  generalized to the two-parameter case. The size-biased
		  random permutation of $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, \theta)$ is a
		  simple residual allocation model proposed by Engen in the
		  context of species diversity and rediscovered by Perman and
		  the authors in the study of excursions of Brownian motion
		  and Bessel processes. For $0 < \alpha < 1,
		  \mathsf{PD}(\alpha, 0)$ is the asymptotic distribution of
		  ranked lengths of excursions of a Markov chain away from a
		  state whose recurrence time distribution is in the domain
		  of attraction of a stable law of index $\alpha$. Formulae
		  in this case trace back to work of Darling, Lamperti and
		  Wendel in the 1950s and 1960s. The distribution of ranked
		  lengths of excursions of a one-dimensional Brownian motion
		  is $\mathsf{PD}(1/2, 0)$ and the corresponding distribution
		  for a Brownian bredge is $\mathsf{PD}(1/2, 1/2)$. The
		  $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, 0)$ and $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, \alpha)$
		  distributions admit a similar interpretation in terms of
		  the ranked lengths of excursions of a semistable Markov
		  process whose zero set is the range of a stable subordinator of index $\alpha$.},

		  of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is
		  illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing
		  and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental
		  problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques
		  for solving these problems are given. The various types of
		  HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as
		  left-right models, are described},

  abstract	= {{Using a sentiment score provided by Thomson Reuters to
		  measure the tone of news articles, this paper examines
		  monthly portfolio returns constructed from information
		  about past news articles. The sentiment score is obtained
		  from the kind of words and phrases that are used in the
		  news article. Positive tone in news articles in the past
		  months predicts positive returns. Similarly, negative tone
		  in the past months predicts negative returns. Past
		  sentiment predicts future returns even for large stocks.
		  The predictive ability of past sentiment dominates the
		  predictive ability of past returns. After controlling for
		  past sentiment, the predictive ability of past returns (in
		  predicting future return) disappears. The findings are
		  robust to multiple specifications. The predictive ability
		  of past sentiment can be used profitably. When applied to
		  the largest decile of stocks, a strategy that takes a long
		  position in stocks with past positive sentiment score and a
		  short position in stocks with past negative sentiment score
		  generates a statistically significant alpha of 34 basis
		  points per month. The resulting portfolio is also
		  positively correlated with a long-short momentum portfolio.
		  Within the same time period, a trading strategy using the
		  sentiment scores from the subset of news articles citing
		  analysts is not profitable. The news items that cite
		  analysts have economically significant contemporaneous
		  returns. The findings suggest that (i) the market
		  underreacts to information contained in news articles, (ii)
		  momentum might be related to underreaction to the sentiment
		  information, and (iii) market participants pay attention to
		  sentiment score information in analyst news. The findings
		  are consistent with a model where one trader has private
		  information and others are trading based on past returns
		  and volume information.}},

@Book{		  vossen-98,
  abstract	= {{This book describes the main objective of EuroWordNet,
		  which is the building of a multilingual database with
		  lexical semantic networks or wordnets for several European
		  languages. Each wordnet in the database represents a
		  language-specific structure due to the unique
		  lexicalization of concepts in languages. The concepts are
		  inter-linked via a separate Inter-Lingual-Index, where
		  equivalent concepts across languages should share the same
		  index item. The flexible multilingual design of the
		  database makes it possible to compare the lexicalizations
		  and semantic structures, revealing answers to fundamental
		  linguistic and philosophical questions which could never be
		  answered before. How consistent are lexical semantic
		  networks across languages, what are the language-specific
		  differences of these networks, is there a
		  language-universal ontology, how much information can be
		  shared across languages? First attempts to answer these
		  questions are given in the form of a set of shared or
		  common Base Concepts that has been derived from the
		  separate wordnets and their classification by a
		  language-neutral top-ontology. These Base Concepts play a
		  fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless, the
		  database may also serve many practical needs with respect
		  to (cross-language) information retrieval, machine
		  translation tools, language generation tools and language
		  learning tools, which are discussed in the final chapter.
		  <br/> The book offers an excellent introduction to the
		  EuroWordNet project for scholars in the field and raises
		  many issues that set the directions for further research in
		  semantics and knowledge engineering.}},

		  course of the col- lection. We derive an efficient
		  variational approximate inference algorithm that takes
		  advantage of the sparsity of observations in text, a
		  property that lets us easily han- dle many time points. In
		  contrast to the cDTM, the original discrete-time dynamic
		  topic model (dDTM) requires that time be discretized.
		  Moreover, the complexity of vari- ational inference for the
		  dDTM grows quickly as time granularity increases, a
		  drawback which limits fne-grained discretization. We
		  demonstrate the cDTM on two news corpora, reporting both
		  predictive perplexity and the novel task of time stamp
		  prediction.},

  abstract	= {{This paper introduces the notion of temporally
		  constrained ranked retrieval, which, given a query and a
		  time constraint, produces the best possible ranked list
		  within the specified time limit. Naturally, more time
		  should translate into bet- ter results, but the ranking
		  algorithm should always pro- duce some results. This
		  property is desirable from a number of perspectives: to
		  cope with diverse users and information needs, as well as
		  to better manage system load and variance in query
		  execution times. We propose two temporally con- strained
		  ranking algorithms based on a class of probabilistic
		  prediction models that can naturally incorporate efficiency
		  constraints: one that makes independent feature selection
		  de- cisions, and the other that makes joint feature
		  selection de- cisions. Experiments on three different test
		  collections show that both ranking algorithms are able to
		  satisfy imposed time constraints, although the joint model
		  outperforms the independent model in being able to deliver
		  more effective results, especially under tight time
		  constraints, due to its ability to capture feature
		  dependencies.}},

  abstract	= "Background: Recent studies have demonstrated the utility
		  of social media data sources for a wide range of public
		  health goals, including disease surveillance, mental health
		  trends, and health perceptions and sentiment. Most such
		  research has focused on English-language social media for
		  the task of disease surveillance. Objective: We
		  investigated the value of Chinese social media for
		  monitoring air quality trends and related public
		  perceptions and response. The goal was to determine if this
		  data is suitable for learning actionable information about
		  pollution levels and public response. Methods: We mined a
		  collection of 93 million messages from Sina Weibo, China's
		  largest microblogging service. We experimented with
		  different filters to identify messages relevant to air
		  quality, based on keyword matching and topic modeling. We
		  evaluated the reliability of the data filters by comparing
		  message volume per city to air particle pollution rates
		  obtained from the Chinese government for 74 cities.
		  Additionally, we performed a qualitative study of the
		  content of pollution-related messages by coding a sample of
		  170 messages for relevance to air quality, and whether the
		  message included details such as a reactive behavior or a
		  health concern. Results: The volume of pollution-related
		  messages is highly correlated with particle pollution
		  levels, with Pearson correlation values up to .718 (n=74,
		  P<.001). Our qualitative results found that 67.1\%
		  (114/170) of messages were relevant to air quality and of
		  those, 78.9\% (90/114) were a firsthand report. Of
		  firsthand reports, 28\% (32/90) indicated a reactive
		  behavior and 19\% (17/90) expressed a health concern.
		  Additionally, 3 messages of 170 requested that action be
		  taken to improve quality. Conclusions: We have found
		  quantitatively that message volume in Sina Weibo is
		  indicative of true particle pollution levels, and we have
		  found qualitatively that messages contain rich details
		  including perceptions, behaviors, and self-reported health
		  effects. Social media data can augment existing air
		  pollution surveillance data, especially perception and
		  health-related data that traditionally requires expensive
		  surveys or interviews. ",

		  communicate more frequently with individuals who share
		  similar value patterns, and further, the extent to which
		  this is true appears to depend at least in part on the
		  value patterns themselves. However, the second hypothesis
		  is not supported - people who communicate more frequently
		  with each other do not necessarily all fit into a
		  particular value type. Thus, values have utility as a novel
		  tool for social network analysis.},

		  of topics, where each topic itself is typically modeled by
		  a unigram word distribution. Documents however often have
		  known structures and the same topic can exhibit different
		  word distributions under different parts of the structure.
		  We extend latent Dirichlet allocation model by replacing
		  the unigram word distributions with a factored
		  representation conditioned on both the topic and the
		  structure. In the resultant model each topic is equivalent
		  to a set of unigrams, reflecting the structure a word is
		  in. The proposed model is more flexible in modeling the
		  corpus. The factored representation prevents combinatorial
		  explosion and leads to efficient parameterization. We
		  derive the variational optimization algorithm for the new
		  model. The model shows improved perplexity on text and
		  image data, but no significant accuracy improvement when
		  used for classification.},
